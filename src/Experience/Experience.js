                    <p>My first job in web was to build features on investor relations (IR) websites - the sites publically traded companies use to display their financial data. The first lines of code I shipped were CSS changes for Facebook's IR site. I loved the rush of pushing code to production and seeing it live moments later.</p>

                    <p>After 1 year, I was promoted to Senior Analyst. I was our team's senior authority on code quality, request management, and training new team members. Loving the adrenaline that stems from working at the intersections of the high-paced fields of finance and tech was a great asset.</p>
